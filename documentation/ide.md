# IDE integration
Like Maven, *PyBuilder* was designed to be convenient to use from the command-line since the commands are very high-level.
Using an IDE integration, however, might improve your workflow and speed.

# Available IDE extensions
* [Sublime text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) plugin.  
  See [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/mriehl/EasyPyb).
